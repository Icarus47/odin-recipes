# odin-recipes

In this project I will create an HTML page detailing different recipes per request of the assignment. 

My primary goal is to build this project in flexbox to give me a better fundemental understanding of flexbox and utilize a little bit of CSS knowledge to create something visually appealing and scaleable.

My secondary goal is to maintain a clean git repository and give myself a better understanding of git and github through practice.
